### Freecodecamp Tribute Page Project

This is a tribute page to the writer Isaac Asimov. I created this page as a project for
the Freecodecamp front-end certification.

## User stories I had to pass

* User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
* User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
* User Story #3: I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".
* User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".
* User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
* User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
* User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page.
* User Story #8: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
* User Story #9: The img element should be centered within its parent element.
